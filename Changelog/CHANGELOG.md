## Version 1.7.9

- **Anima Hires Fix: tiled second pass for high-resolution upscale**
  - On the pixel-upscale Hires path, **Anima-only** detection (`anima` in checkpoint name) routes large upscaled latents through **tiled img2img** instead of a single full-image pass, mirroring ComfyUI USDU and keeping each tile within Anima’s training resolution (~1024-class).
  - **96×96 latent tiles** with **50% overlap** (`pad_latent=48`), **Gaussian blend** stitching, and a **seam-fix pass** (narrow boundary strips at half denoising strength).
  - **Anima-only** dynamic VAE decode normalization before pixel upscaling; **5D decoded latent** normalization and **5D truncate** cropping on the shared Hires path.
  - Hires **sigma schedule** aligned with ComfyUI for Anima img2img. Non-Anima models and **latent-upscale** Hires unchanged aside from v1.7.8 5D helpers.
  - Scoped to **`modules/processing.py`**; SD 1.5 / SDXL / Flux / Wan behavior on latent-upscale Hires is unchanged.
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/v1.7.9) for details.

## Version 1.7.8

- **Hires Fix: 5D tensor compatibility for video/DiT models (Wan / Flux)**
  - Fixed **`ValueError: Input and output must have the same number of spatial dimensions`** during latent-space upscale by locally squeezing/unsqueezing the extra temporal dimension (dim 2) of 5D latents `(N, C, 1, H, W)` around `torch.nn.functional.interpolate`.
  - Fixed **`TypeError: Cannot handle this data type: (1, 1, 1, 1024)`** during pixel-space upscale by squeezing the extra temporal dimension (dim 1) of 5D VAE-decoded outputs `(N, 1, C, H, W)` before processing with NumPy/PIL.
  - Squeezing logic is scoped strictly to 5D tensors; standard 4D latent models (SD 1.5, SDXL, anime models) bypass these blocks entirely and remain unaffected.
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/v1.7.8) for details.

## Version 1.7.7

- **Anima + ADetailer: img2img inpaint flag fix**
  - **`Anima`** engine sets **`is_inpaint = False`** after load so WebUI SD-style latent mask/image concat is not used on Wan **5D** latents.
  - Fixes **`RuntimeError: Tensors must have same number of dimensions: got 4 and 5`** when ADetailer post-processes **`AnimaWai68`** checkpoints (e.g. **`waiANIMA_pw3.safetensors`**) after main txt2img; regional masks still apply via existing **5D** mask blend in img2img **`sample()`**.
  - Change is scoped to **`backend/diffusion_engine/anima.py`** only (same pattern as Qwen / Flux / Lumina); other models unchanged. Commit **`9c85472`**.
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/v1.7.7) for details.

## Version 1.7.6

- **IoPaint Launcher Fix:**
  - Changed default port for IOPaint to **`8081`** to avoid conflicts with ComfyUI's `AiHelper` (which uses `8080`).
  - Implemented a readiness check in `iopaint-cuda.bat` using PowerShell to wait for IOPaint's `/api/v1/server-config` endpoint to return HTTP 200 before launching the browser.
  - Corrected the working directory (`cd`) in `iopaint-cuda.bat` to ensure proper execution.
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/v1.7.6) for details.

## Version 1.7.5

- **ADetailer (built-in extension):** Face detection no longer uses InsightFace (YOLO only).

## Version 1.7.4

- **Pony / SDXL LoRA (CLIP-L): IntegratedCLIP key mapping**
  - **`model_lora_keys_clip()`** in **`modules_forge/packages/comfy/lora.py`** now tries both **`transformer.text_model.encoder.layers.*`** (Transformers 4.x–5.5) and **`transformer.encoder.layers.*`** (Transformers 5.6+ / IntegratedCLIP) so **`lora_te1_*`** keys bind on Pony / SDXL checkpoints.
  - Reduces **`[LORA] LoRA mismatch for CLIP`** when unmatched CLIP keys exceed the 50% gate in **`extensions-builtin/sd_forge_lora/networks.py`** (whole-file skip even if UNet keys match).
  - Commits `3a8ea0c` / `3d1950d` (clip_layer_paths) and Pony SDXL LoRA CLIP fix (`08e6e70`).
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/v1.7.4) for details.

## Version 1.7.3

- **Anima: ComfyUI text encoder import (Step 5a)**
  - Anima TE load and encode now use Comfy **`load_text_encoder_state_dicts`** and **`CLIP.encode_from_tokens`** instead of Forge duplicate **`Qwen3_06B`** and hand-written **`_encode_qwen`**.
  - **`forge_objects.clip`** holds Comfy **`sd.CLIP`** (`AnimaTEModel` + `AnimaTokenizer`) directly; Forge **`CLIP`** wrapper and HF **`tokenizer`** / **`tokenizer_2`** wiring removed from the Anima diffusion engine.
  - Removed Forge **`Qwen3_06BConfig`** / **`Qwen3_06B`** from **`llama.py`** (Anima only; **`Qwen3_4B`** unchanged for other models).
  - **`split_state_dict`**: extract TE keys **before** **`process_clip_state_dict`**, using **`anima_te_filter_prefixes`** for HF **`text_encoders.*`**, Comfy **`cond_stage_model.*`**, and bare **`qwen3_06b.*`** checkpoint layouts.
  - **`AnimaBase`**: expanded **`clip_target`** (six layout patterns) and **`process_clip_state_dict`**; large Anima **`class Anima(AnimaBase)`** inherits TE extraction fixes (previously **`Anima(BASE)`**).
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/v1.7.3) for details.

## Version 1.7.2

- **Nunchaku Z-Image Turbo: Lumina detection regression fix**
  - Anima v1.7.1 Lumina entry required `noise_refiner.k_norm`, but Nunchaku Z-Image Turbo exports use `norm_k` (remapped later in `svdq.py`), so checkpoints were mis-detected as Nunchaku SDXL and failed with `You do not have CLIP state dict!`.
  - Lumina entry now accepts **`k_norm` or `norm_k`** in `modules_forge/packages/huggingface_guess/detection.py` only; Anima guard, Lumina block body, and fuzzy SDXL detection unchanged.
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/v1.7.2) for details.

## Version 1.7.1

- **Anima: ComfyUI import refactor**
  - Replaced the native Forge DiT (`backend/nn/anima.py`) with **`comfy.ldm.anima.model.Anima`** from bundled ComfyUI-master so checkpoint layout, `llm_adapter` placement, and UNet config detection match upstream Comfy.
  - Text path: **`comfy.text_encoders.anima.AnimaTokenizer`** + Forge **`Qwen3_06B`** (embeddings only); **`preprocess_text_embeds`** runs once on the Comfy UNet in `get_learned_conditioning` (no TE-side `llm_adapter`).
  - Loader/detection: **`remap_anima_state_dict`** for key-name fixes only; **`comfy.model_detection.detect_unet_config`** delegate; **`k_model`** 4D↔5D wrap for still-image latents; **`compile_conditions`** omits pooled `y` when absent.
  - UI preset and Additional modules (`qwen_3_06b_base`, `qwen_image_vae`) unchanged from v1.7.0.
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/v1.7.1) for details.

## Version 1.7.0

- **Anima model support**
  - Native Forge support for [circlestone-labs/Anima](https://huggingface.co/circlestone-labs/Anima) and compatible single-file checkpoints (e.g. `anima-base-v1.0.safetensors`, community merges such as `waiANIMA_pw3.safetensors`).
  - New **UI Preset: Anima** in the checkpoint manager; load **Additional modules** `qwen_3_06b_base.safetensors` (Qwen3 text encoder) and `qwen_image_vae.safetensors` (VAE). T5 tokenizer vocabulary is used for `llm_adapter` cross-attention without a separate T5/UMT5 weight file.
  - Native `backend.nn.anima` UNet with flow-matching sampling; **Shift** in the UI applies to the noise schedule.
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/v1.7.0) for details.

## Version 1.6.1

- **UI Preset control: radio buttons to dropdown**
  - Replaced the horizontal SD1.5 / SDXL / Flux / Qwen / Lumina radio preset selector with a **UI Preset** dropdown in the checkpoint manager row (same row as Checkpoint, VAE, and Diffusion in Low Bits).
  - Dropdown labels: SD1.5 (`sd`), SDXL (`xl`), Flux (`flux`), Qwen (`qwen`), Lumina (`lumina`). Existing preset-change behavior (resolution, CFG, sampler, VAE modules, Clip Skip, checkpoint paths) is unchanged.
  - **LoRA tab:** Updated Extra Networks filtering in `javascript/extraNetworks.js` to read the dropdown value instead of legacy radio `checked` state (with a fallback if the old radio UI is still present).

## Version 1.6.0

- **ComfyUI-master update and comfy_aimdo compatibility fixes**
  - Updated the stub packages of `comfy_aimdo` by creating `vram_buffer.py` (`VRAMBuffer` class) and extending `control.py` (`init_devices` method) to ensure compatibility with updated ComfyUI-master startup sequences without the proprietary AIMDO library.
  - Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'comfy_aimdo.vram_buffer'` during startup.
  - Release notes detail error traceback, root cause, and explanation of modifications.
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/v1.6.0) for details.

## Version 1.5.1


- **NumPy 2.4.4 startup compatibility fix**
  - Fixed startup crashes caused by SciPy/diffusers import chains when running with `numpy==2.4.4` by adding `_blas_supports_fpe` compatibility stubs in `launch.py` and `modules_forge/transformers_cache_compat.py`.
  - Updated runtime dependency pins in `requirements.txt` (`Pillow`, `accelerate`, `numpy`, `diffusers`, `protobuf`) to align with the current tested environment.
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/v1.5.1) for details.

## Version 1.5.0

- **Built-in Aspect Ratio extension with resolution calculator**
  - Added a new built-in extension at `extensions-builtin/forge_aspect_ratio` for one-click aspect ratio presets in txt2img/img2img.
  - Added a calculator panel (`Calc`) to compute target resolution from megapixels, aspect ratio, and divisibility (8/16/32/64), then apply directly to width/height sliders.
  - Added configurable presets via `aspect_ratios.txt` and `resolutions.txt`.
  - Integrated MIT-attributed calculation logic adaptation from `ControlAltAI-Nodes` into the Forge extension structure.
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/v1.5.0) for details.

## Version 1.4.9

- **transformers 5.6.2 CLIP compatibility fixes**
  - Fixed transformers 5.6.2 CLIP loading path for SDXL/Nunchaku by normalizing checkpoint key prefixes in `backend/loader.py` (`transformer.` / `text_model.` cleanup then re-map).
  - Updated CLIP text processing access paths for transformers 5.x flattening in `backend/text_processing/classic_engine.py` (`text_model.*` -> direct model attributes).
  - Improved no-init compatibility shim for transformers 5.x in `modules_forge/transformers_cache_compat.py` by patching `PreTrainedModel.init_weights` inside context and restoring it safely.
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/v1.4.9) for details.

## Version 1.4.8

- **ComfyUI-master 0.19.3 sync and AIMDO import compatibility**
  - Updated the bundled `ComfyUI-master` tree to match ComfyUI 0.19.3; upstream now imports optional AIMDO modules (`comfy_aimdo.*`) during startup.
  - Extended the repository `comfy_aimdo` stub package (root and `ComfyUI-master/comfy_aimdo/`) with `host_buffer`, `model_mmap`, and related APIs so Forge starts without the real AIMDO wheel; Forge continues to use its own loader and memory paths.
  - Release notes (English) cover root cause, full traceback, import-flow sequence diagrams, and file-level notes.
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/v1.4.8) for details.

## Version 1.4.7

- **Fresh install and setup bug fixes for Python 3.13, ADetailer initialization, and triton-windows environment setup.** See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/1.4.7) for details.

## Version 1.4.6

- **PyTorch 2.11.0+cu130 defaults, Windows FA2/SA2 wheel URLs, and fixes for `flash_attn` / diffusers startup after torch upgrades.** See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/1.4.6) for details.

## Version 1.4.5

- **Qwen-Image-2512-Fun-Controlnet-Union support**
  - Native support for Qwen Image Fun ControlNet (e.g. Qwen-Image-2512-Fun-Controlnet, Union variants). Uses ComfyUI's `QwenImageFunControlNetModel`; injects control via per-step wrapper into `c["control"]` for Nunchaku and standard Qwen Image backends.
  - Control image is encoded with Forge VAE and passed as raw latent; strength is applied before injection. See Release Notes for implementation details.
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/1.4.5) for details.

## Version 1.4.4

- **ComfyUI-Master update compatibility**
  - Aligned Forge with latest ComfyUI core: removed dependency on deleted `comfy.checkpoint_pickle`; checkpoint loading now uses `torch.load(..., weights_only=True)` only (same as upstream).
  - Added stub package `comfy_aimdo` so ComfyUI code that imports the optional PyPI package `comfy_aimdo` (AIMDO) runs without it; Forge keeps using its own memory/loader.
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/1.4.4) for details.

## Version 1.4.3

- **Float8 + fp16 LoRA: fix crash when switching model across categories**
  - Fixed `"addmm_cuda" not implemented for 'Float8_e4m3fn'` when using "Diffusion in Low Bits" (float8-e4m3fn + fp16 LoRA) and switching to a different model category (e.g. Z-Image ↔ Flux1). LoRA B@A is now computed in fp16 and cast back to Float8 after adding to weights.
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/1.4.3) for details.

## Version 1.4.2

- **wd14-tagger as built-in extension**
  - WD14 Tagger integrated into `extensions-builtin` for image captioning/tagging without a separate install.
- **ComfyUI-Master core refresh**
  - Bundled ComfyUI updated to track upstream; compatible with current ComfyUI-Master for node and model loading.

## Version 1.4.1

- **transformers 5+ compatibility**
  - Shims for `HybridCache` and `no_init_weights` (removed in transformers 5.x) so that the peft / diffusers / nunchaku import chain does not fail at startup.
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/1.4.1) for details.

## Version 1.4.0

- **Improved PEFT format LoRA detection (Nunchaku Qwen Image)**
  - LoRA files created with Hugging Face PEFT (e.g. `.lora_A.default.weight`) are no longer incorrectly skipped as "unsupported"
  - Format detection uses partial match so both standard and PEFT key patterns are recognized as Standard LoRA
  - Log which LoRA files had weights skipped when applicable (e.g. modulation layers apply only to Nunchaku Qwen Image)
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/1.4.0) for details

## Version 1.3.9

- **Config-Presets as built-in extension**
  - Integrated [Zyin055/Config-Presets](https://github.com/Zyin055/Config-Presets) (MIT) as a built-in extension
  - Configurable dropdown to switch txt2img/img2img settings in bulk; create/delete presets; custom fields via `*custom-tracked-components.txt`
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/1.3.9) for details

## Version 1.3.8

- **IoPaint integration**
  - Auto-install iopaint and imghdr (Python 3.13) in `prepare_environment()`; requirements (python-socketio, typer-config, loguru, rembg); `iopaint-cuda.bat` launcher
  - See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Forge-Nunchaku/releases/tag/1.3.8) for details

## Version 1.3.7

- **Model detection / Qwen3**
  - When `detect_unet_config` returns None, strip `unet_key_prefix` before diffusers fallback; reduces SDXL–Flux misdetection and downstream VAE shape mismatch (avoids incorrect Qwen3 load path for SDXL)

## Version 1.3.6

- **ADetailer (built-in extension)**
  - Prevent duplicate face passes per image: only the first face detector tab runs per image; subsequent face tabs are skipped so the same face is not processed twice (hand and other detector tabs unchanged; multiple faces in one image still get one pass each)

## Version 1.3.5
